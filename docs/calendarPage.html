        <p>One staple archive of Behrend 75 is the collection of calendar dates that span throughout
            the 1900s. These calendar entries were simple illustrations with ancedotes of what
            occurred on that day. Though hundreds of these were made time has not treated the
            calendar pages very well. Only 34 pages remain, but they will be held as a special
            portion of Penn State Behrend history as time passes by.</p>
