            <p class="note">I wonder: if this is Mary, did she cut
               and clean her husband's hair? Was she at a hairdresser waiting to have her hair done and saw this while she was waiting? Did they have a housekeeper
               of some kind? I have so many questions. —#rgerzevske</p>
