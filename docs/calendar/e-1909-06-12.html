            <p class="note">This is one of the few pages written entirely in pencil. Unfortunately, this means
               that it isn't very clear to read. From what little I can gather, Mary's family had
               the roof of their house redone and ordered a billiard/pool table, and either her husband
               or someone they know loves to play pool.—#rgerzevske</p>
