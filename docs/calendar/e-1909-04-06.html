                  Two desserts on plates are drawn
                  side by side. The one on the left is a brown color and appears to possibly be
                  a slice of pie or cake. The one on the right is a
                  yellowish colored dessert with frosting on top and cherries around it. Two more desserts are drawn side by side. The one on the
                  left appears to be some ball shaped pastries on a plate. The one on the right is a basket full of colorful desserts or
                  candies.—#lhering #lhering</figcaption>

               <br/>Theresa makes us every day <br/>lovely
               puddings &amp; pies
               <br/>sometimes I order them <br/>sometimes they're a surprise! Don't eat the
               really sweet things!!</div>

         <div class="note">
            <p class="note">It is apparent that Theresa and
               Mary are probably friends because sometimes she gives
               Mary desserts as a surprise. It is also possible that
               Theresa is a baker and owns a bakery.—#lhering</p>
