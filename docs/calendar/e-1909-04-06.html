                  Two desserts on plates are drawn side by side. The one on the left is a brown color
                  and appears to possibly be a slice
                  of pie or cake. The one on the right is a yellowish colored dessert with frosting
                  on top and cherries around it.
                  Two more desserts are drawn side by side. The one on the left appears to be some ball

               <br/>April 6, 1909. <br/>Tuesday
               
               <br/>Theresa makes us every day 
               <br/>lovely puddings &amp; pies
               <br/>sometimes I order them
               <br/>sometimes they're a suprise!
               Don't eat the really sweet things!!</div>
         </div>
         <div class="note">
            <p class="note">It is apparent that Theresa and Mary are probably friends because sometimes she gives
               Mary desserts as
               a suprise. It is also possible that Theresa is a baker and ownes a bakery.—#lhering</p>
