               <br/>Jewels are all very nice <br/> But Ernst &amp; I will think twice <br/>
               Before buying collars <br/> For thousands of dollars <br/>You see we ???????
               the price!
               
               <br/>I don’t want a <br/> dog collar anyway <br/> so it’s all right! <br/> Love
               from Molly.

            <p class="note">This is showing that Mary is very conservative of her money and
               does not want to spend thousands of dollars on jewelry when they could because
               they were very financially stable.—#zmurphy</p>
