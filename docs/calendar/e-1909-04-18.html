               <br/>Jewels are all very nice <br/> But Ernst &amp; I will think twice <br/>
               Before buying collars <br/> For thousands of dollars <br/>You see we ???????
               the price!
               
               <br/>I don’t want a <br/> dog collar anyway <br/> so it’s all right! <br/> Love
               from Molly.
