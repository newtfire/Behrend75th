                  A room is drawn, and within the room is a bed, nightstand with an alarm clock on it,
                  and a window
                  with a view of the sun rising above the horizon. A human is drawn getting out of bed
                  and running over to the
                  alarm clock to shut it off.—#lhering</figcaption>

            <p class="note">Mary has drawn a picture of this bedroom scene and once again uses a pun.
               She says "an early spring". This both referenceing the person in the image getting
               out of bed early, and
               the season of spring coming early.—#lhering</p>
