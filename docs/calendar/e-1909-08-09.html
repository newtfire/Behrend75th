                  An anthropomorphic peach or tomato lady is on the left of the page and a pear lady
                  is drawn on the right. They are made with pencil and watercolor, and the text is about
                  them.—#rgerzevske</figcaption>

               <br/>August 9, 1909. <br/>Monday
               
               
               <br/>Miss Peach has such a
               <br/>lovely face
               <br/>I think it would be
               <br/>out of place
               <br/>to tell you that,
               <br/>tho' never tart,
               <br/>she has a very
               <br/>stony heart;
               <br/>Poor Miss Pear has a
               <br/>swollen cheek;
               <br/>She's had it, too,
               <br/>for nearly a week;
               <br/>If you ask me now
               <br/>how can that be -
               <br/>I'll tell you why:
               <br/>She fell out of a tree!</div>

            <p class="note"> I can tell, from reading enough pages, that Warren has already been born. Since he's a young child, I wouldn't be surprised if Mary tried writing little stories to read to her son. It's almost like something out of
               a children's book, and it reminds me of some of the books I had read to me when I
               was young.—#rgerzevske</p>
