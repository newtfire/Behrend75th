               <br/>Miss Peach has such a <br/>lovely face
               <br/>I think it would be <br/>out of place <br/>to tell you that, <br/>tho' never
               tart, <br/>she has a very <br/>stony heart; <br/>Poor
               Miss Pear has a <br/>swollen cheek;
               <br/>She's had it, too, <br/>for nearly a week; <br/>If you ask me now <br/>how
               can that be - <br/>I'll tell you why: <br/>She fell out of a tree!</div>

            <p class="note"> I can tell, from reading enough pages, that
               Warren has already been born. Since he's a young child, I
               wouldn't be surprised if Mary tried writing little stories to read to her son. It's almost like something out
               of a children's book, and it reminds me of some of the books I had read to me when I was young.—#rgerzevske</p>
