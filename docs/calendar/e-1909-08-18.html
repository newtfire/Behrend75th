            <p class="note"> This is a stark contrast from the previous page; it was somber, likely from losing someone close, and
               now she's drawn something silly about rabbits, a common
               "game" animal. Maybe she knew someone who was hunter, since
               rabbit are common game animals
               when they are not being kept as pets.—#rgerzevske</p>
