            <p class="note">In the picture the woman sitting down is most likely
               Mary Behrend because her initials are written at the
               bottom of the page right next to the lady. Then the woman standing up is most
               likey one of her servants/maids. The infant is probably one of her children and
               most likely Warren because he was born around 1909—#lhering</p>
