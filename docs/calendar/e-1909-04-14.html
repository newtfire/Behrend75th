            <p class="note">In the picture the woman sitting down is most likely Mary Behrend because her initials
               are
               written at the bottom of the page right next to the lady. Then the woman standing
               up is most likey one of her
               servants/maids. The infant is probably one of her childeren and most likely Warren
               because he was born around
