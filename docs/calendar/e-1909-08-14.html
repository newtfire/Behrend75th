            <p class="note"> This is one of the most bizarre calendar pages out of the collection. It's one of,
               if not, the only page that doesn't have a drawing or photo on it. I wonder if she
               couldn't think of anything to draw. Maybe she didn't have time, or maybe this quote
               inspired her. Who knows?—#rgerzevske</p>
