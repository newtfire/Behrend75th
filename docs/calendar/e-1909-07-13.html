                  An infant is seen from behind. Looking closely, the
                  image was made with a different type of paper. It was
                  likely first printed in a magazine, cut out, and glued
                  onto the page.—#rgerzevske #ebeshero</figcaption>

               <br/>That little spot in the <br/>back of his neck <br/>is the sweetest spot to
               <br/>kiss I know <br/>so I kiss him there <br/>and hold
               him close
               <br/>just because I love him so.</div>

            <p class="note">It's clear that Mary is talking about
               her son Warren here. From the way she talks about him, he is
               a few months old (or less) and she absolutely adores him. If
               Warren is her first born child, then her joy from being
               around him makes a lot more sense. —#rgerzevske</p>
