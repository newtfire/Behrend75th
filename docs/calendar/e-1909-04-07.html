               <br/>Ernst wanted a billiard table
               <br/>to play on every day <br/>so we eat in the library
               <br/>just to be out of the way Is the billiard table in the new room
               yet?!</div>

            <p class="note">A billiard table is the same thing that we often refer
               to as a pool table. It is just a different word to describe the same
               thing.—#lhering</p>
