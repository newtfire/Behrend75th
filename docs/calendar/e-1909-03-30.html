            <p class="note">It looks like Mary was in a creative mood
               on this day. Her drawing was quite playful and she also made a pun with the word
               "hare" meaning both "a rabbit"
               and "hair". The joke being that whaen you hear the words "hare dressing" you think about hair being styled but in this picture it
               refers to two rabbits wearing clothes.—#lhering</p>
