                  This one is interesting: there are two cutouts from articles, with one containing a drawing of a large woman and a small
                  man with some text underneath with while the second cutout only consists of
                  text. It is unknown where it came from.—#rgerzevske</figcaption>

               <br/>In case a woman is so large around the waist <br/>That her
               husband can't hug her all at once, he <br/>can take one hug, make a
               chalk mark so as to <br/>know where he left off and
               where to commence <br/>next time going round. 
               
               <br/>I hope I won't be large <br/>again 
               <br/>Care of the Hands in Winter <br/>Floreance. Proper washing and wiping of <br/>the hands will prevent much redness and rough- <br/>ness of the skin. Wipe every part thoroughly <br/>with a soft, absorbent towel. Then rub in some <br/> of the
               following lotion: One ounce of each <br/>glycerine and rose-water; ten drops of tincture
               <br/>of benozine. </div>

            <p class="note">I took care to transcribe the printed text in the images. I
               couldn't read what was entirely in pencil, but I got most
               of it. It sounds like she hasn't had Warren yet, so she is
               worried about her weight and is reading up on skin-care.—#rgerzevske</p>
