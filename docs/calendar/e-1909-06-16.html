               <br/>In case a woman is so large around the waist
               <br/>That her husband can't hug her all at once, he
               <br/>can take one hug, make a chalk mark so as to
               <br/>know where he left off and where to commence
               <br/>next time going round.
               
               
               <br/>I hope I won't be large
               <br/>again 
               <br/>Care of the Hands in Winter
               <br/>Floreance. Proper washing and wiping of
               <br/>the hands will prevent much redness and rough-
               <br/>ness of the skin. Wipe every part thoroughly
               <br/>with a soft, absorbent towel. Then rub in some
               <br/> of the following lotion: One ounce of each
               <br/>glycerine and rose-water; ten drops of tincture
               <br/>of benozine.

            <p class="note">I took care to transcribe the printed text in the images. I couldn't read what was
               entirely in pencil, but I got most of it. It sounds like she hasn't had Warren yet,
               so she is worried about her weight and is reading up on skin-care.—#rgerzevske</p>
