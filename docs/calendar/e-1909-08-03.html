               <br/>Here's a basket of things from <br/>the garden
               <br/>which help to reduce Becker's
               bill
               <br/>Fresh vegetables always taste <br/>nicest <br/>So I am
               sure these will;</div>

            <p class="note"> I don't know if Becker has been
               mentioned before, but he appears he is a close friend of the
               Behrends. I remember that around this time more people were
               encouraged to start gardens (If I am remembering
               correctly), and Maryoffering fresh fruits
               and vegetables to someone, friend or neighbor, was a sign of
               goodwill.—#rgerzevske</p>
