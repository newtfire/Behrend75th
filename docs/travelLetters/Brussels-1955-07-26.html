               Dear People:
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-1">We are just about to take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit- ting
                  around so I will try to send this second installment of our trip report. If I
                  remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in
                  <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the <span class="transport">train</span> to
                  fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very
                  unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at
                  <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in cold tub. We went out for
                  dinner later and cele- brater with <span class="person"><b><i>Charles
                           Jubilee</i></b></span>. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a
                  <span class="transport">car</span> and guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>.
                  It is so beautiful but so expensive<span class="x" title="?"><s>!</s></span>
                  <span class="fade">$</span>90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the
                  <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the Left Bank, got
                  <span class="transport">train</span> tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de
                     Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it
                  but did see it, so that is that.</p>
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-2">The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and
                  his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior Berheron</span>, where we stayed as a
                  m<span class="spelling" title="member"></span>m<span class="space" title="She left a space."></span>ber of the family were terribly nice. We
                  arravied in time for lunch and then got in a little car and went
                  through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it
                  traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.
                  Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after dinner we
                  went to a nearby chateau, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.
                  They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting
                  which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.</p>
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-3">Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and
                  ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before.
                  We
                  had a picnic on the way and <span class="x" title=""><s><span class="hand">tea</span></s></span> on the way home. Great
                  fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all
                  about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row
                  with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge
                  wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when
                  it was going on.</p>
               
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-4">
                  Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for
                  lunch. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some
                  shopping.</p>

               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-5">and walked around. This we dis. Not too many purchases. We were going upto
                  <span class="place">montmartre</span> but decided to get to bed early to leave for
                  <span class="place">Brussels</span> the next day.</p>
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-6">We had a perfect flight from <span class="place">London</span> here. Mercedes Bucher met us
                  at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and
                  came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious lunch, food is
                  marvelous here, on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is fantatic. Mercedes has a
                  <span class="transport">car</span> so we spent the afternoon seeing
                  <span class="place">Brussels</span> which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had
                  dinner in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.
                  Sunday we piled into the <span class="transport">car</span> and went to
                  <span class="place">Burges</span>, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We
                  took a ride in a <span class="transport">carriage</span> all over the town. Great fun. On
                  the way back we stopped for tea in the <span class="place">Osten</span> which is
                  a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light supper
                  on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.
                  Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had
                  cocktails at the <span class="place">Wilsons hotel</span> and dinner
                  later.</p>
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-7"> It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for
                  <span class="place">Copen- hagen</span> arriving there at <span class="time">4:30</span>. Have to change
                  planes in <span class="place">Amsterdam</span>. Mer- bill etc. The <span class="person"><b><i>Wilsons</i></b></span> left
                  a while ago for <span class="place">Paris</span>. We will see them in <span class="place">London</span> in
                  August.</p>
               
               <p id="brusselsJuly26.xml-n-8">We see by the paper that it is still unberable in <span class="place">New York</span> and
                  are pleased to be here. weather has been perfect except for the day we arrived.</p>
