               <span class="place">The Manoir de Bécheron</span> is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling <span class="Period">15th-16th Century</span> house 
               situated in the peaceful valley of the<span class="place"> Indre</span> in the heart of the <span class="place">Chateaux de la Loire region</span>. The air of Old World charm
               with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast,
               which is served in your room 
               or if you choose, in the gardens.
               You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them
               are such famous artists as <span class="person"><b><i>Alexander 
                        Calder</i></b></span>, <span class="person"><b><i>Max Ernst</i></b></span> and <span class="person"><b><i>A. Ozenfant.</i></b></span>
               Bécheron is 25 kilometers from Tours, which can be reached by rail from <span class="place">Paris</span> in about two and half hours. Of course we
               meet you at the station.
               The rate in high-season <span class="date"><b><i>(June 15</i></b></span>-<span class="date"><b><i>August 31</i></b></span>) is $15 a day or $100 a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, 
               wines, liqueurs, coffee and service). This includes the local excursions around <span class="place">Bécheron</span> such as <span class="place">Saché,</span> <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau,</span>
               Tours, <span class="place">Langeais.</span> <span class="place">The Saché Museum </span>now houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, <span class="person"><b><i>Jo Davidson.</i></b></span> The off-season
               rate <span class="date"><b><i>(March 1</i></b></span>-<span class="date"><b><i>June 14</i></b></span>; <span class="date"><b><i>Sept. 1</i></b></span>-<span class="date"><b><i>October 31)</i></b></span> is $10 a day or $65 a week per person. Contrary to the usual continental practice
               there are no extra charges at Bécheron.
               My French wife and I have two children,<span class="person"><b><i> Eva</i></b></span> age 12 and <span class="person"><b><i>Laurent</i></b></span> who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find 
               they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours
               while touring <span class="place">Europe, Bécheron</span> is 
               the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the <span class="place">United States</span> and speak French and English as of course we do.
               A week in <span class="place">Bécheron</span> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
               illuminated chateaux;
               they alone are worth the trip. The <span class="place">"Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span>, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
               a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
               During one of your outings we will picnic in the <span class="place">Forêt de Loches</span> near a circular <span class="Period">12th Century</span> chapel, or on the banks of the
               Loire across from <span class="place">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
               on a picturesque medieval square.
               We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
               We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
               you may have. 
               Write for us.</p>
