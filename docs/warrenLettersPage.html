            <p>This website is dedicated to presenting and marking up in text the final letters written
            by Warren Behrend shortly before he passed away later on an icy day in December of 1929.
            The letters in question were directed to his mother and father, Mary and Ernst Behrend
            whom later sold their land to Penn State. Our goal is to enlighten people on the life of
            Mary Behrend's son Warren and how he spent his final days before his sacrifice.</p>
