                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>life crowded as it was with all the rich promise of a most useful and happy
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>career, then suddenly ccrowned by sacrificing all to the safety of children,
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>though the children themselves were unkown to him.
                        <br/>
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>boys and girls will dedicate your lives to the great tasks of life, not
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>sparing yourselves but giving youselves instantly and cheerfully when duty 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>calls, then the beautiful example of this splendid young man will not have 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>been in vein.
                        <br/>
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>From what we learn of his exalted character we think that we
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>would wish nothing better than that these children spared by his heroic
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.
