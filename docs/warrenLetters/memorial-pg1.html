                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>On December 19th, 1929 <span class="person">Warren Behrend</span> on his way to join his family 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>for the Christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
                        <br/>
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>have suffered with him.
                        <br/>
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span><span class="person">Warren's</span> deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>and of unselfish service. This deed should, and I confidently trust, will be 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.
                        <br/>
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure <span class="person">Warren's</span> heroic deed enacted in our
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>others rather than to ourselves.
                        <br/>
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>more particularly the children whose lives were saved by <span class="person">Warren Behrend's</span> heroism,
                        <br/><span class="ln"></span>with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful
                        <br/></p>
