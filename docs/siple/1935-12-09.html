                    <p>
                        Dear <span class="person">Mr. Behrend</span>,
                        It is with great pleasure that I present this little token of friendship. This
                        rock was picked up on the "ash dump" - a unique moraine running out from the base
                        of
                        an extinct volcano, <span class="place">Mt. Raymond Fosdick</span> in the <span class="place">Edsel
                            Ford Mountain Range</span> of northern <span class="place">Marie Byrd
                                Land, Antarctica</span>. <br/>
                        The land was first discovered from the air by <span class="person">Admiral
                            Byrd</span> in 1929, but it was first visited by our party
                        travelling by dog team during October - December, 1934. The Marie Byrd Land
                        sledging party was composed of four men - <span class="person">Alton Wade</span>,
                        Geologist,<span class="person">Stevenson Corey</span> and <span class="person">Olin Stancliff</span>,
                        drivers and assistants, and myself as leader and Biologist. <br/>
                        The volcano was at the extreme turning point of our travels, about three
                        hundred miles from <span class="place">Little America</span>. Corey and I spent Thanksgiving Day near the point
                        where this rock was picked up in a blizzard that blew almost continuously for three
                        days at a velocity rarely below thirty five miles an hour, and often of hurricane
                        velocity completely flattening our tent. <br/>
                        The sextant you so kindly loaned us helped to guideus through the
                        hundreds of weary, uncharted miles, and I return it to you with deepest
                        appreciation and with it a piece of the Antarctic contintent
                        itself. <br/>
                    </p></div>
