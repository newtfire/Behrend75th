Long COPY Hammermill Paper Company&#xA;        &#xA;            NV&#xA;            GD&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;     &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;             1929-12-19&#xA;            &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            On December 19th, 1929 Warren Behrend on his way to join his family &#xA;            for the Christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left&#xA;            turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this &#xA;            man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these&#xA;            children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-&#xA;            fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but&#xA;            an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines&#xA;            some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly&#xA;            have suffered with him.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this&#xA;            community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.&#xA;            Warren's deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to &#xA;            every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty &#xA;            and of unselfish service. This deed should, and I confidently trust, will be &#xA;            an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to&#xA;            duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            As you young people look out into the world today the call to &#xA;            unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are &#xA;            in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for &#xA;            these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,&#xA;            and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure Warren's heroic deed enacted in our&#xA;            midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to &#xA;            others rather than to ourselves.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and &#xA;            more particularly the children whose lives were saved by Warren Behrend's heroism,&#xA;            with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            life crowded as it was with all the rich promise of a most useful and happy&#xA;            career, then suddenly ccrowned by sacrificing all to the safety of children,&#xA;            though the children themselves were unkown to him.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you&#xA;            boys and girls will dedicate your lives to the great tasks of life, not&#xA;            sparing yourselves but giving youselves instantly and cheerfully when duty &#xA;            calls, then the beautiful example of this splendid young man will not have &#xA;            been in vein.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            From what we learn of his exalted character we think that we&#xA;            would wish nothing better than that these children spared by his heroic&#xA;            decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            &#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;" x="25" y="20"></text></a><line x1="5" y1="-10" x2="5" y2="40" style="stroke:#41ACA0;stroke-width:3"></line>

I &#xA;            hope you had nice weather so&#xA;            that you could enjoy driving South&#xA;            in the Duesenburg &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            Ned Richardson and I have&#xA;            both promised each other to drive care-&#xA;            fully. and arenothing our parents&#xA;            such a promise. You already have&#xA;             mine anyway buthere it is again. &#xA;            Don't worry.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;         &#xA;            I am going to drop in and see&#xA;            Harriettomorrow night.Miss Black- &#xA;            stone said that brothermight get&#xA;            through the portals to see their sisters.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            I have a &#34;blind date&#34; for to-&#xA;            morrow night in New York. If&#xA;            you know what a blind date is&#xA;            you will realize that I awaite it&#xA;            with fear trembling. The only thing &#xA;            the girl who made the date knows&#xA;            about me is that I am 5'8&#34; tall.&#xA;         &#xA;        &#xA;            Tomorrow we have 20 minute&#xA;            periods and are all through at&#xA;            11.30. As I have no classes the &#xA;            sixth and seventh periods I shall&#xA;            be all through at 10.50. This works&#xA;            out very well, because Mr.Oatley&#xA;       &#xA;            &#xA;            is leaving at eleven o'clock for&#xA;            Springfield in his car. He is going&#xA;            to take us unknown along and so that&#xA;            gives us plenty of time to get the one&#xA;            o'clock out of Springfield. That&#xA;            gives Ned a chance to stay off in&#xA;            New Haven and gives me a chance &#xA;            to see Harriet.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            I'm looking forward to seeing you&#xA;            in Charleston soon and it will&#xA;            be mighty nice to have the whole family&#xA;            together again. I'm telephoning Betty&#xA;            Brattontonight find out whether&#xA;            she can come and if so when. If she&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            can come you will have received&#xA;            a telegram from me before you get&#xA;            this letter. I think she is bring another  &#xA;            boy and another girl with her. Do &#xA;            you think we can find room for all?&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            I received the map and tickets &#xA;            O.K.

I am be-&#xA;            ginning to feel more like I was&#xA;            going home when we all live&#xA;            on board her than when in the &#xA;            house in Erie.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;             Please drop me a line some &#xA;             time and tell me what arrange-&#xA;        &#xA;             ments you made about&#xA;             daring the La Salle meet &#xA;             me in Washington. If&#xA;             you haven't done this just say so&#xA;             and I'll write Miss Fraters. I&#xA;             shall probably write her anyway as &#xA;             I want to be sure the boot for&#xA;             the toy is in the car and have&#xA;             the wings put  back on again.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;             I haven't been able to get in&#xA;             touch with Betty Bratton yet &#xA;             but I shall probably phone her&#xA;             tonight if I can find out where&#xA;             she lives. There is small informal&#xA;       &#xA;             dance here next Saturday and&#xA;             if she has no definite plans for &#xA;             next december Christmas and might&#xA;             be able to go I'll ask her if for&#xA;             that so that we can talk over the &#xA;             matter. I think Harriet would like&#xA;             it better if I could get someone to&#xA;             sort of keep her company. I'll write &#xA;             you to New York the * * the&#xA;             phone call.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;             I'm not at all sure I'll have&#xA;             time to make the enlargements you &#xA;             want, but if I do I'll be glad to &#xA;             make them. Enlargements take a lot&#xA;        &#xA;             of time and messing around.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;             There is not as much snow&#xA;             here as there was in Erie, but&#xA;             it very cold. The water question&#xA;             is getting quite serious here now&#xA;             and they are planning to drill a&#xA;             number of wells next week. The&#xA;             springs at the Eaglehook dried out &#xA;             yesterday and so that is the jist&#xA;             throws all the more drain on the&#xA;             town system.&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;             Hope you have a nice trip&#xA;             South. &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            Much love,&#xA;            Warren&#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;" x="25" y="80"></text></a><line x1="5" y1="50" x2="5" y2="100" style="stroke:#41ACA0;stroke-width:3"></line>

At Noon, July 18, 1955.&#xA;        We got on board about 10&#xA;    Harriet had stayed in Greenwich over night so went in town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our &#xA;    bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two suut cases each and a &#34;bottle bag and the typewriter-plus&#xA;    a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on thebbottem of a suit case for future use!&#xA;        State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE&#xA;    surprise'Caryl had arranged it this way Gail's mother and a friend- Dale and Kissy got to the dock just after 10.30 &#xA;    and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.&#xA;        Huge ship. Like a section of the Waldorf- the Reacock Alley plus several of the dining rooms- afloat Streams of &#xA;    PEOPLE nulling about.&#xA;&#xA;        We had a table in the dining room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us over and&#xA;        next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed&#xA;        to-gether. &#xA;    Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the movies and pools. I won a few dollars on a pool.&#xA;        A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there&#xA;        were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she &#xA;        was to steer (ab??) over Europe. She came up and has tea with us one day.&#xA;        The Captain and Purser both were on the Franconia about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.&#xA;        Both exptremely cordial. &#xA;        Took train around noon for Paris. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.&#xA;        Paris and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at Le Br istol- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble &#xA;        and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need and later gave up.)&#xA;        Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the Crenailliere(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.&#xA;   &#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;" x="25" y="0">07-18</text></a><line x1="5" y1="0" x2="15" y2="0" style="stroke:#80B022;stroke-width:2" transform="translate(0,-4)"></line><a href="Paris-1955-07-19.html">

Went to &#xA;            Lubin's for perfrume (had the pink flannel faffair that Harriet had given me—REsented') Walked around the circle—Place -de Vendome to&#xA;            Caron, The Ritz Hotel, and a jewellers&#xA;            where I was intregues by a Jewelled bird. But did NOT get it! To a very nice resturant in&#xA;            the Bois for lunch Le Pre Catalan. Went thento both sides of the Siens and got some little&#xA;            prints of Paris. R.R. station and Tourist Agency|reg. tickets.  We had our evening meal at the&#xA;            Bristol and then set out for the Casion deParis.

If I&#xA;                remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in&#xA;                    Cherbourg and got safely on the train to&#xA;                fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to Paris. Very&#xA;                unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at&#xA;                    Le Bristol was fall in cold tub. We went out for&#xA;                    dinner later and cele- brater with Charles&#xA;                Jubilee. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a&#xA;                    car and guide and we drove all over Paris.&#xA;                It is so beautiful but so expensive!&#xA;                $90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the&#xA;                    Bois de Boulougne shopped on the Left Bank, got&#xA;                    train tickets and that night went to the Casino de&#xA;                    Paris. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it&#xA;                but did see it, so that is that.&#xA;            The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and&#xA;                his wife who ran the Manior Berheron, where we stayed as a&#xA;                    mmber of the family were terribly nice. We&#xA;                arravied in time for lunch and then got in a little car and went&#xA;                through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it&#xA;                traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.&#xA;                Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after dinner we&#xA;                went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.&#xA;                They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting&#xA;                which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.&#xA;            Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and&#xA;                ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before. We&#xA;                had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great&#xA;                fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all&#xA;                about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row&#xA;                with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge&#xA;                wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when&#xA;                it was going on.&#xA;&#xA;            &#xA;                Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for&#xA;                    lunch. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some&#xA;                shopping.&#xA;          &#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;            &#xA;            July 26th letter&#xA;        &#xA;        &#xA;         &#xA;            and walked around. This we dis. Not too many purchases. We were going upto&#xA;                    montmartre but decided to get to bed early to leave for&#xA;                    Brussels the next day.&#xA;            We had a perfect flight from London here. Mercedes Bucher met us&#xA;                at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and&#xA;                came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious lunch, food is&#xA;                marvelous here, on the Grand Place which is fantatic. Mercedes has a&#xA;                    car so we spent the afternoon seeing&#xA;                    Brussels which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had&#xA;                    dinner in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.&#xA;                    Sunday we piled into the car and went to&#xA;                    Burges, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We&#xA;                took a ride in a carriage all over the town. Great fun. On&#xA;                the way back we stopped for tea in the Osten which is&#xA;                a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light supper&#xA;                on the Grand Place which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.&#xA;                Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had&#xA;                    cocktails at the Wilsons hotel and dinner&#xA;                later.&#xA;             It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for&#xA;                    Copen- hagen arriving there at 4:30. Have to change&#xA;                planes in Amsterdam. Mer- bill etc. The Wilsons left&#xA;                a while ago for Paris. We will see them in London in&#xA;                    August.&#xA;            We see by the paper that it is still unberable in New York and&#xA;                are pleased to be here. weather has been perfect except for the day we arrived.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;             Much love to all from both of us.&#xA;        &#xA;    &#xA;    &#xA;" x="25" y="160">07-26</text></a><line x1="5" y1="160" x2="15" y2="160" style="stroke:#80B022;stroke-width:2" transform="translate(0,-4)"></line><a href="copenhagen-1955-07-28.html">

Then to Oscar Davidson's where the&#xA;                Menu is several yards long- all open faced&#xA;                    sadnwhiches. Didn't think so much of this place.

A large building in a park- open fields with many&#xA;                herds of deer roaming about &#xA;             In the evening we were invited to Mr Dessau's f or&#xA;                dinner. his son William came in to get us. Very nice and&#xA;                friendly. Almost everyone seems to speak English. They get a terrific lot of it in&#xA;                the schools. Mrs Dessau looks very young Had another son&#xA;                    there-ROul- and his very sweet bride of a few months. She&#xA;                was born in Mexico and in fact IS&#xA;                    Mexican but lived a long time in&#xA;                    Texas. Does notnSpeak Danish. After&#xA;                meeting them all Mr Dessau Asked us to see his&#xA;                    garden. He had several hundred&#xA;                    parakets in a huge cage- like a big&#xA;                room- and arranged so they could fly in and out. Then he&#xA;                showed us his special pets Two tame Kangaroo!! They hopped out of&#xA;                their enclosure and like to me patted. Very tame. He has had them several years. T&#xA;                gave Mrs Dessau one of my little trimmed&#xA;                    Christmas trees And to the bride a little &#34;shelf&#34; which was&#xA;                really Mexican and I had trimmed it over and remade it&#xA;                They werre very pleqsed. had a nice evening and enjoyed&#xA;                them all.

WEnt to several fu places One&#xA;            especially Mrs Dessau told us of. But after we had seen others went&#xA;            back to Bangs, which is really the most&#xA;            &#34;swell&#34;establishment- and bought the short jacket we liked in the first place. then we&#xA;            went to Friendrichborg palace,where we went in.

WEnt to a vehyrm charming palace- a resturant where&#xA;            we had a view of the castle, looking over a lake. then we proceeded to&#xA;                    Friedensborg palace, the summer r&#xA;            Residence of the King. We were allowed to see just a series of&#xA;            rooms on the lower floor. All wrapped up in covers and the curtains all covered up.&#xA;                OLD FASHioNeD BUT NICE To elsinore -but did not go&#xA;                in.Called KronbergCastle Drive back along the&#xA;            coast.Lots of bicycles- many with little children clinging on the back.

We speculate the date must be before July 29, 1955.&#xA;      &#xA;          The Manoir de Bécheron is a private home which welcomes a few paying guests. It is a rambling 15th-16th Century house &#xA;    situated in the peaceful valley of the Indre in the heart of the Chateaux de la Loire region. The air of Old World charm&#xA;    with modern comfort. The cuisine is French, meals are 'en famille', except for breakfast, which is served in your room &#xA;    or if you choose, in the gardens.&#xA;    You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American neighbors. Among them are such famous artists as Alexander &#xA;    Calder, Max Ernst and A. Ozenfant.&#xA;    Bécheron is 25 kilometers from Tours, which can be reached by rail from Paris in about two and half hours. Of course we&#xA;    meet you at the station.&#xA;    The rate in high-season (June 15-August 31) is $15 a day or $100 a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, &#xA;    wines, liqueurs, coffee and service). This includes the local excursions around Bécheron such as Saché, Azay-le-Rideau,&#xA;    Tours, Langeais. The Saché Museum now houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, Jo Davidson. The off-season&#xA;    rate (March 1-June 14; Sept. 1-October 31) is $10 a day or $65 a week per person. Contrary to the usual continental practice&#xA;    there are no extra charges at Bécheron.&#xA;    My French wife and I have two children, Eva age 12 and Laurent who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find &#xA;    they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours while touring Europe, Bécheron is &#xA;    the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the United States and speak French and English as of course we do.&#xA;    A week in Bécheron is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the illuminated chateaux;&#xA;    they alone are worth the trip. The &#34;Sleeping Beauty&#34; castle of Usse, Azay-le-Rideau, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but &#xA;    a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.&#xA;    During one of your outings we will picnic in the Forêt de Loches near a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the&#xA;    Loire across from Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours &#xA;    on a picturesque medieval square.&#xA;    We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
