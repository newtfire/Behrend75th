            that he wanted to do the expedition because it was a challenge that he seemed up to
            doing and that it would probably be a good fit for him. "Well, it was the nature of a
            challenge to me, at my age, a young fellow, casting around and at that time, the
            Depression, I thought it might be adventuresome and I thought I'd see if I could be
            accepted as a member of the party. I didn't want to just go down to the ice on the ship,
            I wanted to be member of the ice party and stay for the year."</note>
