            <p>   We got on board about 10
               Harriet had stayed in <span class="place">Greenwich</span> over night so went in town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our 
               bags. Very cleverlym selected as we had two suut cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus
               a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag(reserved for purchases. THIS folded up on
               thebbottem of a suit case for future use!
               State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had a send of party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain and was a HUGE
               surprise'Caryl had arranged it this way Gail's mother and a friend- Dale and Kissy got to the <span class="place">dock</span> just after 10.30 
               &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 7c5c7ba1280104f896b2754c1dfa81f90f0c4f14
               and were not allowed to come on board. Too bad.
               Huge ship. Like a section of the <span class="place">Waldorf- the Reacock Alley</span> plus several of the <span class="place">dining</span> rooms- afloat Streams of 
               PEOPLE nulling about.
               
               We had a table in the <span class="place">dining</span> room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us
               over and
               next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ew ano anoother lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange addresses and werephotographed
               to-gether. 
               Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the <span class="place">movies</span> and <span class="place">pools</span>. I won a few dollars on a pool.
               A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then there
               were the parties of the Captain and the Purser Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight in cabin class, she 
               was to steer (ab??) over <span class="place">Europe</span>. She came up and has tea with us one day.
               The Captain and Purser both were on the <span class="place">Franconia</span> about years ago- as under officers- on a world cruise wer were on.
               Both exptremely cordial. 
               Took train around noon for <span class="place">Paris</span>. Hot as blazes. and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
               <span class="place">Paris</span> and piled our belongings intoo a cab and landed at <span class="place">Le Br istol</span>- a rather smallish hotel were diplomats go- white marble 
               and mirrors. We had an oval white panelled round sitting room. (which we didn't need
               and later gave up.)
               Very weary and after some refreshing tub baths went over to the <span class="place">Crenailliere</span>(nearby) where we had a very delicious dinner.</p>
