            <p> Did letter and left the Astoria with Otto and the ford
               car- our new car and driver for our jaunt.Went to Bang andlooked at
               fur jackets.And then to jensens where Gail made a purchase. To
               Weacvers embroidery shop. Then to <span class="place">Oscar Davidson's</span> where the
               Menu is several yards long- allopen faced
               sadnwhiches. Didn't think so much ofthis place. Then to the
               <span class="place">Permente</span> again and then back to the astoria to pack up our
               things and left for the <span class="place">Palace Hotel</span> where
               we had a rather nice room etc. Then we rushed out to the <span class="place">Rosenborg
                  Palace</span> to see the jewels etc. It was close in about half an hour so
               didn't have too much time.After this we drove out to the <span class="place">Royal
                  Deer Park</span>. A large building in a park- open fields with many
               herds of deer roaming about </p>
            
            <p> In the evening we were invited to Mr Dessau's f or
               dinner. his son William came in to get us. Very nice and
               friendly. Almost everyone seems to speak English. They get a terrific lot of it in
               the schools. Mrs Dessau looks very young Had another son
               there-ROul- and his very sweet bride of a few months. She
               was born in <span class="place">Mexico</span> and in fact IS
               Mexican but lived a long time in
               <span class="place">Texas</span>. Does notnSpeak Danish. After
               meeting them all Mr Dessau Asked us to see his
               <span class="place">garden</span>. He had several hundred
               parakets in a huge cage- like a big
               room- and arranged so they could fly in and out. Then he
               showed us his special pets Two tame Kangaroo!! They hoppedout of
               their enclosure and like to me patted. Very tam. He has had them several years. T
               gave Mrs Dessau one of my little trimmed
               Christmas trees And to the bride a little "shelf" which was
               really Mexican and I had trimmed it over and remade it
               They werre very pleqsed. had a nice evening and enjoyed
               them all. Also we LIKE the Toborg beer better than ant other kind!! </p>
