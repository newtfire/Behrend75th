            <p> Still at the <span class="place">Palace Hotel</span>. WEnt to several fu places One
               especially Mrs Dessau told us of. But after we had seen others went
               back to <span class="place">Bangs</span>, which is really the most
               "swell"establishment- and bought the short jacket we liked in the first place. then
               we
               went to <span class="place">Friendrichborg palace</span>,where we went in. A
               huge place with mucH to see. Orders of the White
               Elephant. etc. IN- Took pictures of the storks on the chimney tops. They
               return these nests about <span class="date">May 8th</span> every year. WEnt to a vehyrm charming palace- a resturant where
               we had a view of the castle, looking over a lake. then we proceeded to
               <span class="place">Friedensborg palace</span>, the summer r
               Residence of the King. We were allowed to see just a series of
               rooms on the lower floor. All wrapped up in covers and the curtains all covered up.
               OLD FASHioNeD BUT NICE To elsinore -but did not go
               in.Called <span class="place">KronbergCastle</span> Drive back along the
               coast.Lots of bicycles- many with little children clinging on the back. One little
               boy
               calmly eating a sort of ice cream cone- while his mother rode along with him hanging
               on.
               Again we wandered over to Tivoli and had a simple meal over there. and went to bed
               early
               as we had a days jaunt before us for the next day- to bournhiolm , the danish Island. An air plane to get there!
