                     <p id="FRANCE.xml-n-3">  <span class="place">Brussles</span> - Dear People: We are just about to
                        take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit-ting around so I will try to send this second
                        intallement of our trip report. If I remember correctly, the last letter came from
                        the <span class="transport">boat</span>.
                        We arrived in <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the <span class="transport">train</span> to find that it was over 90. We nearly
                        died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very unairconditioned <span class="transport">train</span> and blazing sun. The first thing we
                        did when we arrived at <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in a cold tub. WE went out for <span class="meal">dinner</span> later and
                        cele-brated with Cherrie Jubilee. Very Tasty! The next day <span class="person"><b><i>Mrs. Behrend</i></b></span> hired a car and
                        guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>. It is so beautiful but so expensive? $90 a minute to
                        breath! We did a bit of shopping, had <span class="meal">lunch</span> in the <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the <span class="place">Left
                           Bank</span>, got <span class="transport">train</span> tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I
                        must say. We were not carried away by it but see it, so that is that. The next morning
                        we
                        were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. the man and his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior
                           Bercheron</span>, where we stayed as a member of the family were terribly nice. We arrived in time
                        for <span class="meal">lunch</span> and got in a little <span class="transport">car</span> and went through some beautiful country to see some of the
                        <span class="place">chateaux</span>. We enjoyed it tremendously. You can see where all the old French painters got all
                        their inspirations. Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after
                        <span class="meal">dinner</span> we
                        went to a nearby <span class="place">chateau</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span> which was illuminated. Just like <span class="place">fairyland</span>. They
                        also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting which
                        told the
                        history of the <span class="place">building</span>. We will never forget it. Thursday, the <span class="person"><b><i>Davidsons</i></b></span>, our hosts and
                        their little boy and ourselves went on another <span class="place">chateaux</span> trip which was just a grand as the
                        day before. We had a picnic on the way and tea on the way home. Great fun. The only
                        thing
                        that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all about everything and
                        told it
                        in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter-rible row with him about sports. Everyone
                        was on my
                        side but you couldn't get a word in edge wise. It was was rather funny to look back
                        on but I
                        nearly had a nervous breakdown when it was going on. Friday we left Tours at about
                        eleven
                        and got back in <span class="place">Paris</span> for <span class="meal">lunch</span>. After the lovely meal we charged out on foot to do some
                        shopping. </p>

                        My French wife and I have two children,<span class="person"><b><i> Eva</i></b></span> age 12 and <span class="person"><b><i>Laurent</i></b></span> who is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find 
                        they are never underfoot. If you should want a place where you can safetly leave yours
                        while touring <span class="place">Europe, Bécheron</span> is 
                        the place you are looking for. Our children were born in the <span class="place">United States</span> and speak French and English as of course we do.
                        A week in <span class="place">Bécheron</span> is over before you realize it! You won't want to miss the thrilling sight of the
                        illuminated chateaux;
                        they alone are worth the trip. The <span class="place">"Sleeping Beauty" castle of Usse</span>, <span class="place">Azay-le-Rideau</span>, famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but 
                        a few of the fabulous palaces which surround us.
                        During one of your outings we will picnic in the <span class="place">Forêt de Loches</span> near a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the
                        Loire across from <span class="place">Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars</span>. We will also take you to one of the outstanding restaurants of Tours 
                        on a picturesque medieval square.
                        We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without your children.
                        We'll be glad to answer any specific questions
                        you may have.

                        We had a table in the <span class="place">dining</span> room with 5 other femal ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked us

                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-1">We are just about to take off for <span class="place">Copenhagen</span> and are sit- ting
                        around so I will try to send this second installment of our trip report. If I
                        remember correctly, the last letter came from the boat. We arrived in
                        <span class="place">Cherbourg</span> and got safely on the <span class="transport">train</span> to
                        fin that it was over 90. We nearly died on the ride to <span class="place">Paris</span>. Very
                        unairconditioned train and blazing sun. The first thing we did when we arrived at
                        <span class="place">Le Bristol</span> was fall in cold tub. We went out for
                        <span class="meal">dinner</span> later and cele- brater with <span class="person"><b><i>Charles
                                 Jubilee</i></b></span>. Very tasty! The next day Mrs. Behrend hired a
                        <span class="transport">car</span> and guide and we drove all over <span class="place">Paris</span>.
                        It is so beautiful but so expensive<span class="x" title="?"><s>!</s></span>
                        <span class="fade">$</span>90 a minute to breath! We did a bit of shopping, had lunch in the
                        <span class="place">Bois de Boulougne</span> shopped on the Left Bank, got
                        <span class="transport">train</span> tickets and that night went to the <span class="place">Casino de
                           Paris</span>. Pretty naked ladies I must say. We were not carried away by it
                        but did see it, so that is that.</p>
                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-2">The next morning we were up at the crack of dawn and off to Tours. The man and
                        his wife who ran the <span class="place">Manior Berheron</span>, where we stayed as a
                        m<span class="spelling" title="member"></span>m<span class="space" title="She left a space.">-</span>ber of the family were terribly nice. We
                        arravied in time for <span class="meal">lunch</span> and then got in a little car and went
                        through some beautiful country to see some of the chateaux. We enjoyed it
                        traemndously. You can see where the old French painters get all their inspirations.
                        Lovely rivers, old mills and beautiful trees. That night after <span class="meal">dinner</span> we
                        went to a nearby chateau, Azay-le-Rideau which was illuminated. Just like fairyland.
                        They also had a sort of play very cleverly done just done with voices and lighting
                        which told the history of the building. We will never forget it.</p>
                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-3">Thursday, the Davidsons, our hosts and their little boy and and
                        ourselves went on another chateaux trip which was just a grand as the day before.
                        We
                        had a <span class="meal">picnic</span> on the way and <span class="x" title="tea"><s>day</s></span> on the way home. Great
                        fun. The only thing that marred the trip was another guest who arrived who knew all
                        about everything and told it in the loudest of voices. I got in a ter- rible row
                        with him about sports. Everyone was on my side but you couldn't get a word in edge
                        wise. Itwas rather funny to look back on but I nearly had a nervous breakdown when
                        it was going on.</p>
                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-4">
                        Friday we left Tours at about eleven and got back in Paris for
                        <span class="meal">lunch</span>. After the lovely meal we changed out on foot to do some
                        shopping.</p>
                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-5">and walked around. This we dis. Not too many purchases. We were going upto
                        <span class="place">montmartre</span> but decided to get to bed early to leave for
                        <span class="place">Brussels</span> the next day.</p>
                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-6">We had a perfect flight from <span class="place">London</span> here. Mercedes Bucher met us
                        at the airport and we came to the hotel. the Wilsons, Mrs. BBs cousin, called and
                        came over for a drink. We then went for a delicious <span class="meal">lunch</span>, food is
                        marvelous here, on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is fantatic. Mercedes has a
                        <span class="transport">car</span> so we spent the afternoon seeing
                        <span class="place">Brussels</span> which is very pretty. Lovely park and old buildings. Had
                        <span class="meal">dinner</span> in a very old place with lots of atmoshpere and good food.
                        Sunday we piled into the <span class="transport">car</span> and went to
                        <span class="place">Burges</span>, about and hour and a half away. A divine old town. We
                        took a ride in a <span class="transport">carriage</span> all over the town. Great fun. On
                        the way back we stopped for tea in the <span class="place">Osten</span> which is
                        a big seaside resort. Arrived back here at eight and ha a light <span class="meal">supper</span>
                        on the <span class="place">Grand Place</span> which is illuminated at night and breathtaking.
                        Yesterday we shopped most of the day and walked around seeing things. All had
                        cocktails at the <span class="place">Wilsons hotel</span> and dinner
                        later.</p>
                     <p id="parisJuly26.xml-n-7"> It is now Tuesday again and we leave here at 12:55 for
