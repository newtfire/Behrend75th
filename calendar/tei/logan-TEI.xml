                     woman on the left is sitting in a <rs type="object">chair</rs> holding the
                     child. The woman on the right is standing next to her holding <rs type="object"
                        >clothing</rs> for the child. Both women are wearing long <rs type="object"
                        >dresses</rs>. The one standing up is also wearing an <rs type="object"
                        >apron</rs> and appears to possibly be a maid. It looks like she is holding
                     a <rs type="object">bonnet</rs> and a <rs type="object">dress</rs> for the
                     child.</figDesc>

               <note resp="#lhering">In the picture the woman sitting down is most likely
                     <persName>Mary Behrend</persName> because her initials are written at the
                  bottom of the page right next to the lady. Then the woman standing up is most
                  likey one of her servants/maids. The infant is probably one of her children and
                  most likely <persName>Warren</persName> because he was born around 1909</note>
