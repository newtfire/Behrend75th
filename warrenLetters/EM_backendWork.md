# Backend work for warrenLetters by EM

RNC:

Alrighty, so I checked the Relax NG (.rnc) files against the XML in the folder and fixed whatever was in the red. So, as it is now, the XML agrees with the RNC. 

Unclear:

I also went through and tried to resolve the elements marked 'unclear' and added comments marking them as resolved if the previous editors had a discussion in the file. However, there are still words that are 'unclear'.

Reread:

I also read the XML and compared it to the photos to check the accuracy. (I did find some differences, but I also may have missed a few things, so if you want to do a quick review, that wouldn't hurt.)

(´•ᴥ•`)

TLDR: 

I did cleanup to make sure the XML for warrenLetters was clean based of the RNC as well as try to resolve anything marked as 'unclear'.
