            <ln n="1"/>It won't be very long now
            <ln n="2"/>before we will all be together 
            <ln n="3"/>again on the <transport>Amida</transport>. I am be-
            <ln n="4"/>ginning to feel more like I was
            <ln n="5"/>going home when we all live
            <ln n="6"/>on board her than when in the <!-- jbg:removed the unclear element on board. -->
            <ln n="7"/>house in <placeName placeId="ERIE">Erie</placeName>.
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            <ln n="1"/> Please drop me a line some <!-- seb: changed "dust" to "drop" after rereading -->
            <ln n="2"/> time and tell me what arrange-
        <pb n="2"/>
            <ln n="3"/> ments you made about
            <ln n="4"/> <unclear reason="hard to read">daring</unclear> the La Salle meet <!-- seb: i beleive "daring" is actually "having" -->
            <ln n="5"/> me in <placeName placeId="WASH">Washington</placeName>. If
            <ln n="6"/> you haven't done this just say so
            <ln n="7"/> and I'll write <persName personId="MF">Miss <unclear reason="unclear name">Fraters</unclear></persName>. I
            <ln n="8"/> shall probably write her anyway as <!-- seb: took out extra word -->
            <ln n="9"/> I want to be sure the boot for
            <ln n="10"/> the <object>toy</object> is in the <transport>car</transport> and have
            <ln n="11"/> the wings put <crossOut/> back on again.

        <p n="3">
            <ln n="1"/> I haven't been able to get in
            <ln n="2"/> touch with <persName personId="BB">Betty Bratton</persName> yet 
            <ln n="3"/> but I shall probably phone her
            <ln n="4"/> tonight if I can find out where
            <ln n="5"/> she lives. There is small informal
       <pb n="3"/>
            <ln n="6"/> dance here next Saturday and
            <ln n="7"/> if she has no definite plans for <!-- seb: added word "plans" -->
            <ln n="8"/> next <crossOut>december</crossOut> Christmas and might
            <ln n="9"/> be able to go I'll ask her <unclear reason="hard to read">if for</unclear>
            <ln n="10"/> that so that we can talk over the <!-- seb: changed "no" to "so" and "that" to "the" -->
            <ln n="11"/> matter. I think <persName personId="Harriet">Harriet</persName> would like
            <ln n="12"/> it better if I could get someone to
            <ln n="13"/> sort of keep her company. I'll write <!-- seb: added words "sort of" -->
            <ln n="14"/> you to <placeName>New York</placeName> the * * the
            <ln n="15"/> phone call.

        <p n="4">
            <ln n="1"/> I'm not at all sure I'll have
            <ln n="2"/> time to make the enlargements you <!-- seb: removed extra "i'll have" -->
            <ln n="3"/> want, but if I do I'll be glad to 
            <ln n="4"/> make them. Enlargements take a lot
        <pb n="4"/>
            <ln n="5"/> of time and messing around.

        <p n="5">
            <ln n="1"/> There is not as much snow
            <ln n="2"/> here as there was in <placeName placeId="Erie">Erie</placeName>, but
            <ln n="3"/> it <weather>very cold</weather>. The water question
            <ln n="4"/> is getting quite serious here now
            <ln n="5"/> and they are planning to drill a
            <ln n="6"/> number of wells next week. The
            <ln n="7"/> springs at the <placeName placeId="EAGLE">Eaglebrook</placeName> dried out <!-- seb: added s to "springs" -->
            <ln n="8"/> yesterday and so that <crossOut>is the jist</crossOut>
            <ln n="9"/> throws all the more drain on the
            <ln n="10"/> town system.
