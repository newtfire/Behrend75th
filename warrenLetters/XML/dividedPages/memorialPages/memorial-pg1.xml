            <ln n="1"/>On December 19th, 1929 <person personId="WAR">Warren Behrend</person> on his way to join his family 
            <ln n="2"/>for the Christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
            <ln n="3"/>turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
            <ln n="4"/>man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
            <ln n="5"/>children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            <ln n="6"/>in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
            <ln n="7"/>fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
            <ln n="8"/>an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
            <ln n="9"/>some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
            <ln n="10"/>have suffered with him.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            <ln n="11"/>it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
            <ln n="12"/>community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic <emotion>sacrifice</emotion>.
            <ln n="13"/><person personIdRef="WAR">Warren's</person> deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
            <ln n="14"/>every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
            <ln n="15"/>and of unselfish service. This deed should, and I confidently trust, will be 
            <ln n="16"/>an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
            <ln n="17"/>duty even though it may mean to <emotion>sacrifice</emotion>.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            <ln n="18"/>As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
            <ln n="19"/>unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
            <ln n="20"/>in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
            <ln n="21"/>these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
            <ln n="22"/>and unselfish <emotion>sacrifice</emotion>. May we not treasure <person personIdRef="WAR">Warren's</person> heroic deed enacted in our
            <ln n="23"/>midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
            <ln n="24"/>others rather than to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            <ln n="25"/>This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
            <ln n="26"/>more particularly the children whose lives were saved by <person personIdRef="WAR">Warren Behrend's</person> heroism,
            <ln n="27"/>with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful
