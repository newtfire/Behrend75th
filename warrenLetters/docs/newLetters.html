                  <p>
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>On December 19th, 1929 <span class="person">Warren Behrend</span> on his way to join his family 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>for the Christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
                     <br/>
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>have suffered with him.
                     <br/>
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span><span class="person">Warren's</span> deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>and of unselfish service. This deed should, and I confidently trust, will be 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.
                     <br/>
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure <span class="person">Warren's</span> heroic deed enacted in our
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>others rather than to ourselves.
                     <br/>
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>more particularly the children whose lives were saved by <span class="person">Warren Behrend's</span> heroism,
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful

                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>though the children themselves were unkown to him.
                     <br/>
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you

                     <br/>

                     <br/><span class="ln"></span>decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.

                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> There is not as much snow
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> here as there was in <span class="place">Erie</span>, but
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> it very cold. The water question
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> is getting quite serious here now
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> and they are planning to drill a
                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> number of wells next week. The

                     <br/><span class="ln"></span> yesterday and so that is the jist
