               It is raining hard and freezing on 
               <br/><span class="n">4</span>.
               the trees; very beautiful indeed, but not
               <br/><span class="n">5</span>.
               so practical for people who would drive

               their cars on a night like this. I 
               <br/><span class="n">7</span>.
               hope you had nice weather so

               you know what a blind date is
               <br/><span class="n">23</span>.
               you will realize that I awaite it
               <br/><span class="n">24</span>.
               with fear trembling. The only thing 
               <br/><span class="n">25</span>.
               the girl who made the date knows

               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">27</span>.
               Tomorrow we have 20 minute
               <br/><span class="n">28</span>.
               periods and are all through at
               <br/><span class="n">29</span>.
               11.30. As I have no classes the 
               <br/><span class="n">30</span>.
               sixth and seventh periods I shall
               <br/><span class="n">31</span>.
               be all through at 10.50. This works
               <br/><span class="n">32</span>.
               out very well, because Mr.Oatley
               
               
               <br/><span class="n">33</span>.
               is leaving at eleven o'clock for
               <br/><span class="n">34</span>.
               Springfield in his car. He is going
               <br/><span class="n">35</span>.
               to take us unknown along and so that
               <br/><span class="n">36</span>.
               gives us plenty of time to get the one
               <br/><span class="n">37</span>.
               o'clock out of Springfield. That
               <br/><span class="n">38</span>.
               gives Ned a chance to stay off in
               <br/><span class="n">39</span>.
               New Haven and gives me a chance 
               <br/><span class="n">40</span>.
               to see Harriet.
               <br/>

               <br/><span class="n">43</span>.
               be mighty nice to have the whole family
               <br/><span class="n">44</span>.
               together again. I'm telephoning Betty
               <br/><span class="n">45</span>.

               <br/><span class="n">46</span>.
               she can come and if so when. If she

               <br/><span class="n">47</span>.
               can come you will have received

               O.K. Someone may thoughtfully mark- 
               <br/><span class="n">54</span>.
               ed the rest wrote in red pencil. Wish 
               <br/><span class="n">55</span>.
               I knew who it was so that I could thank
               <br/><span class="n">56</span>.
               them.
               <br/>

                it better if I could get someone to

                I'm not at all sure I'll have

                I'll have time to make the enlargements you

                want, but if I do I'll be glad to 
               <br/><span class="n">39</span>.
                make them. Enlargements take a lot

               <br/><span class="n">2</span>.
               On December 19th, 1929 Warren Behrend on his way to join his family 
               <br/><span class="n">3</span>.
               for the Christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
               <br/><span class="n">4</span>.
               turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
               <br/><span class="n">5</span>.
               man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
               <br/><span class="n">6</span>.
               children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">7</span>.
               in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
               <br/><span class="n">8</span>.
               fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
               <br/><span class="n">9</span>.
               an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
               <br/><span class="n">10</span>.
               some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
               <br/><span class="n">11</span>.
               have suffered with him.
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">12</span>.
               it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
               <br/><span class="n">13</span>.
               community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.
               <br/><span class="n">14</span>.
               Warren's deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
               <br/><span class="n">15</span>.
               every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
               <br/><span class="n">16</span>.
               and of unselfish service. This deed should, and I confidently trust, will be 
               <br/><span class="n">17</span>.
               an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
               <br/><span class="n">18</span>.
               duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">19</span>.
               As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
               <br/><span class="n">20</span>.
               unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
               <br/><span class="n">21</span>.
               in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
               <br/><span class="n">22</span>.
               these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
               <br/><span class="n">23</span>.
               and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure Warren's heroic deed enacted in our
               <br/><span class="n">24</span>.
               midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
               <br/><span class="n">25</span>.
               others rather than to ourselves.
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">26</span>.
               This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
               <br/><span class="n">27</span>.
               more particularly the children whose lives were saved by Warren Behrend's heroism,
               <br/><span class="n">28</span>.
               with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">29</span>.
               life crowded as it was with all the rich promise of a most useful and happy
               <br/><span class="n">30</span>.
               career, then suddenly ccrowned by sacrificing all to the safety of children,
               <br/><span class="n">31</span>.
               though the children themselves were unkown to him.
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">32</span>.
               If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you
               <br/><span class="n">33</span>.
               boys and girls will dedicate your lives to the great tasks of life, not
               <br/><span class="n">34</span>.
               sparing yourselves but giving youselves instantly and cheerfully when duty 
               <br/><span class="n">35</span>.
               calls, then the beautiful example of this splendid young man will not have 
               <br/><span class="n">36</span>.
               been in vein.
               <br/>
               <br/><span class="n">37</span>.
               From what we learn of his exalted character we think that we
               <br/><span class="n">38</span>.
               would wish nothing better tan that these children spared by his heroic
               <br/><span class="n">39</span>.
               decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.
